# PacMan

## A recreation of the original Pacman. Will run simillarly to the orignal with some edits.


My reasons for wanting to build this are as follows:
- To pay homage to the original Pacman
- To relive some nostalgia
- To better understand the process of software design

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to move Pacman
- As a user, I want Pacman to eat pellets and receive a score for each pellet
- As a user, I want to pick up powers and ghosts and add them to the inventory
- As a user, I want to use powers and ghosts from the inventory (Powers to make the ghosts edible, and ghosts to turn into friendly ghosts when used for a couple of turns)

- As a user, I want to be able to save my game into a JSONObject
